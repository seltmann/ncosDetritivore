#An ANOVA
summary(aov(seeds ~ cage,data=nipomo2017))

#A two-way ANOVA informs you whether the effect of one of your independent variables on the dependent variable is the same for all values of your other independent variable. In this example, is effect of cage type on seed set influenced by landscape topography?

#The two-way ANOVA compares the mean differences between groups that have been split on two independent variables (called factors). The primary purpose of a two-way ANOVA is to understand if there is an interaction between the two independent variables (cage and Topo) on the dependent variable (seeds). If it was caged or not, did that affect Topo? Dependant variables are not the ones you are varying.

#use TukeyHSD to do post-poc analysis to tell you were the significance pairing is
#When writing results you need the p value and the F value
#diff: difference between means of the two groups
#lwr, upr: the lower and the upper end point of the confidence interval at 95% (default)
#p adj: p-value after adjustment for the multiple comparisons.
#adjusted p-value < 0.05 = standard significant with only 5% chance that the differences are random or reject hypothesis with a 95% probability.
